The WIreless Digital Audio Transfer or WiDAT for short, is a Linux based 
application for transferring sampled audio data from a client known as "talker" 
to another client (or server) called "listener".

The sampled audio data that the widat program can transfer could be acquired 
from either
(1) stored .wav file
(2) real time audio captured from microphone.

In the second case, widat utilizes the ALSA library to capture the audio samples.
On the listener end, the play-back of the received audio samples is done via
ALSA library play-back API calls.

Pre-requisite for building from source
========================================
In order to compile the widat program successfully, the following linux packages
need to be installed as dependency :
* libasound2
* libasound2-dev

Instructions for build
========================
On the top level, for building the listener, invoke
make listener

To build the talker, invoke :
make talker

If the widat talker is to record data from microphone, build it as :
make AUDIO_SRC=mic talker

To clean all the build binaries, invoke :
make clean

To build both the talker and listener in one shot :
make all
or
make AUDIO_SRC=mic all

Using the widat program
========================
On the host which is to send the audio data, invoke the talker program :
./talker <host> <filename.wav>
or
./talker <host> 

In the first case, the mentioned file's audio data is transferred to any 
online listener program running on host.
In the second case, the talker program captures audio from microphone and sends
the samples to the listener.

On the host which is to receive the transferred audio sample data, invoke :
./listener

Both the listener and talker programs are designed to run infinitely, hence
once execution is started for the programs, enter Control+C to terminate
the programs.
